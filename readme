problem 1: Finding the sum of distinct elements from a set

- Declare a "sum" variable which is the sum of all the distinct elements.
- create a function with a loop and conditions to determine if the elements are distinct or exist in both arrays.
- if the conditions for distinct elements are satisfied, then increment sum variable
- Upon completion of the loops return the total sum.

problem 2: Determine orthogonal vectors

- Declare an array variable to contain vector pairs that are orthogonal
- Create a loop that tests the orthogonal vector characteristic
- if test returns true, then push the current value pair into the array variable
- console.log the array
