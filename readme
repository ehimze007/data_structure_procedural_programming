problem 1: Finding the sum of distinct elements from a set

- Declare a "sum" variable which is the sum of all the distinct elements.
- Declare a variable that stores the element value based on the conditions being satisfied.
- Loop through the first parameter; check each element against the elements of the second parameter.
  - if the element of the first parameter is present in the second parameter array, then let the arrayValue = 0;
  - if the previous condition is false, then assign the current value of first parameter to arrayValue
- repeat same task; looping through the second parameter and nesting the loop of the first parameter
- return the sum

problem 2: Determine orthogonal vectors

- Declare an array variable to contain vector pairs that are orthogonal
- Create a loop that tests the orthogonal vector characteristic
- if test returns true, then push the current value pair into the array variable
- console.log the array
